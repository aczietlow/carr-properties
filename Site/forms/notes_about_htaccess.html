and .htaccess<span style="line-height:115%">:</span></b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
<br>
Our Web Forms Package should run under PHP4, PHP5, and PHP6.<br>
But on some servers, some tweaking may be needed. See below.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Running under PHP5</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With the adopting of PHP5 by most modern web hosts and 
control panels, there is a need to understand “how” your web host and server is 
running PHP5 in addition to just whether it supports it or not.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Apache 2.0x – 2.2x supports compiling either PHP4&nbsp; or PHP5 
or BOTH. If you are running both on your server – then your host will most 
likely have a protocol for invoking PHP 4 if PHP5 is running. More often than 
not this is done via a file extension such as “whatever.php4”.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
Verdana">This is because it is not possible to run both PHP5 and PHP4 as Apache 
modules, rather one must be run as CGI, with the other one being run as an 
Apache module.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
Verdana">In the case of an upgrade at the hosting level, most likely the PHP5 
will be run as a module while PHP4 will be run as CGI.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Helpful tips &amp; workarounds to aide running our forms or 
other scripts under PHP5:</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Put an .htaccess in your /public_html/ (cPanel) or /httpdocs/ 
(PLESK) or root directory, with:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;AddHandler application/x-httpd-php4 .php</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This will allow your scripts to access PHP4 after any 
upgrade to PHP5.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>How to tell if you are running PHP 4 or 5 and whether it 
is run under phpsuexec</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The first 
step is to find out if your server is using phpsuexec. This can be done by 
running a simple 'php info' script.<br>

</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font face="Verdana">
<span class="content">
									<font size="2">To check which version of PHP 
is installed on your website's server, we have included the file <b>phptest.php</b> 
which contains just the following line of code:<br>

&nbsp;</font></span></font>

After uploading to your server: enter the full url of this file into 
your browser. For example: <b>http://www.your-website.com/forms/<a href="phptest.php">phptest.php</a></b>.</font></span></font></p>
<b>Note:</b> For added security, you might wish to delete this file from your 
server when you are done.</font><p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana">
<font size="2">Load the file in your browser and in the top section find the line 'Server API'. 
If it shows 'CGI' then your account is on a server with phpsuexec. If it lists 
the server API as 'apache' you are not on a phpsuexec server.<br>
<br>
The next step is to add the appropriate command to your .htaccess file. For the 
primary domain name on an account the .htaccess file should be located in the 
public_html folder. Create the file if it does not exist. If it does exist, then 
make sure to save a backup copy. <br>
Rename it .htaccess-backup. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana">
<font size="2">Place one of the 
following commands in the file:<br>
<br>
If your account is not on a phpsuexec server use:<br>
<br>
AddType application/x-httpd-php5 .php<br>
<br>
If your account is on a phpsuexec server use:<br>
<br>
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php</font></span></p>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">For your convenience, we have included 3 
	.htaccess files located in your download. We have name them something like
	<b>z-.htaccess-AddHandler-application-php4.txt</b>.<br>
	<br>
	Rename the appropriate file <b>.htaccess</b> (it will not function with the name we 
	have given it. Your server looks for a file named <b>.htaccess</b>).<br>
	<br>
	You might try all 3 files if the first one doesn't do the job. It might work 
	perfectly by keeping it in the &quot;forms&quot; directory. But you might need to 
	place it in the &quot;root&quot;, which is usually called htdocs or public_html. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In other words:<br>
	Your web hosting service must have PHP installed and properly configured for 
	the program to run. Please make sure they have PHP and what version they are 
	using. Bestwebforms will work with PHP 4.2.0 or later. <br>
	Rename the file z-.htaccess-AddHandler-application-php4.txt (for PHP 4) to 
	.htaccess,<br>
	or rename z-.htaccess-AddHandler-application-php5.txt (for PHP 5) to 
	.htaccess and try to access your web forms again. If that doesn't work, you 
	must ask your hosting service to add an application handler for proper 
	execution of your PHP files.<br>&nbsp;</font></div>
